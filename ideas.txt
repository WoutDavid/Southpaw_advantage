- exploratory: proving the platoon effect is real by showing significance in performance vs lefties/righties of hitters?
    - Effect = wOBA (opposite arm) â€“ wOBA (same arm), data taken from mlb stats, used some webscraping. 
    - Data on hitters' hand is taken from https://github.com/Rkabacoff/qacData/blob/main/data/batting.rda

- classification: check if i can find L and R by use of stats: performance vs L/or R would be easy, but i cant find data for that so lets try the more difficult one and use the variables speed and break, and see if i can make a tree/NN that can predict a pitcher being lefthanded or not
- classification backup: checking to see if you can classify lefties/righties based on performance agains lefties/righties
- clustering: the same as classification but unsupervised
- Factor: see if i can find the underlying factor "has a working offspeed pitch"
- biplot: find correlation between speed and spin?
