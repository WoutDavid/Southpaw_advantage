- exploratory: proving the platoon effect is real by showing significance in performance vs lefties/righties of hitters?
    - Effect = wOBA (opposite arm) â€“ wOBA (same arm), data taken from mlb stats, used some webscraping.
    - source: https://cutt.ly/njO7YYH
- classification: check if i can find L and R by use of stats: performance vs L/or R would be easy, but i cant find data for that so lets try the more difficult one and use the variables speed and break, and see if i can make a tree/NN that can predict a pitcher being lefthanded or not
- clustering: the same as classification but unsupervised
- backup classification: see if i can find factors explaining team or NLvsAL this might be better for batters instead of pitchers tho
- Factor: see if i can find the underlying factor "has a working offspeed pitch
- biplot: find correlation between speed and spin?
