- exploratory: proving the platoon effect is real by showing significance in performance vs lefties/righties of hitters?
    - Effect = wOBA (opposite arm) â€“ wOBA (same arm), data taken from mlb stats, used some webscraping. 
    - Data on hitters' hand is taken from https://github.com/Rkabacoff/qacData/blob/main/data/batting.rda
    - source: https://cutt.ly/njO7YYH

- classification: check if i can find L and R by use of stats: performance vs L/or R would be easy, but i cant find data for that so lets try the more difficult one and use the variables speed and break, and see if i can make a tree/NN that can predict a pitcher being lefthanded or not
- classification backup: checking to see if you can classify lefties/righties based on performance agains lefties/righties
- clustering: the same as classification but unsupervised
- Factor: see if i can find the underlying factor "has a working offspeed pitch"
- biplot: find correlation between speed and spin?


TODOs found by going through the course material:
- histogram
- outliers- see PCA: univariate distribution
- covariance matrix: show that the variables are correlated, not independant, same for correlation matrix
- ANOVA to show that there is significant difference between the two groups?
- Log regression to show the platoon effect

What am I expecting to find?:
- platoon effect: batters hit better agains same opposite hand pitchers
- changeup should be the only thing on which lefties have a higher spin rate 


Ordination: 
- PCA to see how many clusters it finds
- Factor analysis to see what variables are necessary - this works well cause its highly correlated
- Biplot cause he loves it

Clustering:
- Hierarchical clustering to see what it does

Outline: 
1) introduction
2) Showing the platoon effect with boxplots
3) Discovering pitch metric stats: explorations
4) Showing correlated structure between the variables --> FA might be good then
5) Clustering to show that L vs R isn't really the grouping structure that's being found
6) Classification to see if I can build something that will find the R vs L structure.
